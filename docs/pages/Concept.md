# Concept

Transparent observables are important for the following reasons

- they are less errorprone and prevent memory leaks. This is similar to how higher order programming languages don't need to manage memory manually, because it is handled automatically
- they are easier to learn and use because close to natural language
- almost every user interface is reactive and needs code that handles reactivity. Traditional approaches are inefficient
