# Functional Reactive Programming

Heinrich Apfelmus said "The essence of functional reactive programming is to specify the dynamic behavior of a value completely at the time of declaration."
Functional reactive programming consists of two parts: The functional part and the reactive part.
The functional part is that the behavior of variables is determined at the initialization, which may or may not make programs easier to understand, because understanding what that variable does is defined at one place instead of scattered throughout the codebase.

With programming paradigms there are always rules that make programming stricter and with less possibilties in return for structural advantages.

The main parts of functional programming are

- avoid side effects / pure functions / immutability


## Elliot

Conal Elliot says that the parts that define functional reactive programming are

- precise and simple denotation
- Continous time
