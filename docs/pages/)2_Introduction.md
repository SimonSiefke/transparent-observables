# Introduction

Creating user interfaces is hard. The goal of this paper is to explore reactive programming for web applications and how reactive programming can make building user interfaces easier to build, easier to understand and easier to maintain. This paper focuses on interfaces for the web, but the patterns are not exclusively for the web.

The web is especially interesting because of accessibility. Accessibility means two similar things here: First that web applications can be used by everyone, regardless of disabilities. Second that web applications can be used on many different devices.

Web applications have a very broad use: One use case are websites. There are approximately 1.5 billion websites. Another use case are progressive web apps. Progressive web apps are websites on FIRE: Fast - They don't have as much code as normal websites and have advanced caching. Integrated - They can be accessed from mobile devices like a native app, with an icon on a home screen and without a browser surrounding the website. Reliable - Once loaded, they work offline & with flaky internet connections (via caching). Engaging - They can send push notifications like native apps

Progressive web apps make websites more accessible for users on every device, but especially for people with low-end devices and slow internet connections.

Progressive web apps can also be installed on laptops and pc's, which makes them easier to access for laptop and pc users.

Web technologies are also popular for more advanced desktop applications, for example Visual Studio Code by Microsoft, Atom by Github both use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on top of Electron which is a framework for developing desktop applications that have access to the file system, can execute commands etc.
